        <h1>THE BIG FIVE GALLERY</h1>
        <p>The Big Five—lion, leopard, elephant, rhinoceros, and buffalo—are more than just majestic creatures of the wild; they are the soul of Africa’s untamed heart. Once known as the most dangerous animals to hunt on foot, today they symbolize beauty, strength, and the deep need to protect what’s left of the wild. Each one tells a story: the lion’s pride, the leopard’s mystery, the elephant’s wisdom, the rhino’s resilience, and the buffalo’s quiet power. Together, they remind us of nature’s raw magic—and our responsibility to keep it alive.</p>

        <img src="./images/elephant-working-forest-kerala-india.jpg" alt="Elephant in the forest">
        <p> In the heart of a lush Kerala forest, a weary yet majestic elephant stands amidst a bed of green leaves, its powerful frame softened by the quiet sadness in its eyes. A chain hangs gently from its neck, whispering of captivity beneath the canopy of freedom. Its weathered skin and worn tusk speak of years spent in silent strength and service. Surrounded by nature’s beauty, it seems both a part of the wild and painfully apart from it. This gentle giant carries not just weight, but stories—of endurance, of loss, and of deep, unspoken wisdom.</p>

        <img src="./images/rhino.jpg" alt="Rhino by water">
        <p>By the still water’s edge, a lone rhino lowers its head, sipping gently as its reflection gazes back in silence.<br>  
            Its armor-like skin tells tales of survival, strength etched into every fold and scar. <br> 
            Surrounded by green, it stands like a relic of time—ancient, noble, and quietly enduring.<br>  
            There’s a quiet dignity in its presence, a reminder of wild beauty holding on in a fading world.</p>

      <div class="gallery-item">
        <img src="./images/tiger.jpg" alt="Tiger in the forest">
        <p> Eyes locked with fierce intent, the tiger moves with silent grace through the forest’s shadows.
            Each step is power contained, a dance between danger and beauty.
            Its amber coat burns like fire against the green hush of the wild.
            A living legend—majestic, untamed, and heartbreakingly rare.</p>

      <div class="gallery-item">
        <img src="./images/buffalo.jpeg" alt="a buffalo in the sunset">
        <p> With heavy hooves and a heart rooted in the earth, the buffalo stands calm and unshaken.
            Its deep, dark eyes hold the quiet strength of ancient lands and long-forgotten storms.
            Every breath it takes feels like a song of endurance and survival.
            A gentle giant, forged by time, weathered but proud.

      <div class="gallery-item">
        <img src="./images/lion.jpeg" alt="a buffalo in the sunset">
        <p> The lion walks like thunder wrapped in golden fur, every step echoing quiet authority.  
            His eyes burn with the weight of battles won and kingdoms kept.  
            The wind bends around him—not in fear, but in reverence.  
            He is more than a beast; he is a living crown of the wild.
